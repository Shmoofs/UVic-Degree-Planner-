# UVic-Degree-Planner-

!!Future Project!!

A tool to aid students in planning their semesters.

Completed Project would be able to:
-> Collect when UVic courses are offered when
-> Allow you to put in which courses you took to account for pre-requisites
-> Allow you to plan future semesters with a focus on pre-requisites and co-requisites
